# cpp_chess_engine

This is my first attempt at creating a chess engine. I had originally planned to make a chess engine as a personal project, however a course that I decided to take COMP4121 required a trimester long project and hence I decided to use this project to learn more about algorithms. Currently this project is incomplete.

## Completed Tasks

- created a bitboard representation of a chessboard

## In Progress

- working on move generation function

## TODO

- move evaluation
- search algorithm (will attempt to use monte carlo tree search)
